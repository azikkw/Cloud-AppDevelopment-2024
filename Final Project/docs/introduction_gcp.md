The main advantage of such platforms is scalability, flexibility and fault tolerance. Also, an important advantage of such cloud platforms is a wide range of ready-made services and tools, which significantly saves development time and resources. 

The Google Cloud Platform offers a user-friendly console with a user interface and analytics tools. GCP includes technologies such as:

3. Cloud Kubernetes Engine
4. Cloud Function and Cloud Endpoints
5. Various cloud storages such as Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Firestore for data storage
6. And a wide range of different services, technologies and APIs
